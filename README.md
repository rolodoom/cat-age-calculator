A single-page app that converts cat years to their human year equivalents React+TailwindCSS+Vite, with fuzzy classification by life stage.

- Each additional year = +4 human years

| < 0.5 years | Kitten |
| 0.5–2 years | Young |
| 2–7 years | Adult |
| 7–11 years | Middle-aged |
| > 11 years | Senior |
